Binary/Machine language [Low level Language]:
- Binary Number system[ only 2 digits 0 and 1] base 2
- problem with the binary is code is error-prone and difficult understand, write, debug
- it takes a lot of time to write code
- it will be expensive software
- extensibility is hard
- it is not user-friendly
- we have to write a lot of code for simple requirements

#Asembly language :
- English like words, mnemonics e.g ADD NUM1, NUM2
- Translator or assembler will translate the english code in binary.


#High level programming language
- C,C++, C#, Java
- easy to understand for the developer.

Computer : Compute[Process, Calculate]

- What is Java?
    -  it is high level programming language.

- Language is the medium for the communication.
- Every language has set of rules, grammar rules , set of characters,

- programming is nothing but set of instructions given to computer.

* Platform:
- It is an environment which lets you execute the softwares.
- Hardware platform: Machine
- software platform : OS [Windows, mac, linux]
Why Java?
- Simple: a lot of complex concepts from C, C++ are removed
- secure: no direct to access to memory locations, provided built-in security managers
- platform independent
- Write Code Once Run Anywhere[WORA]
    App.java ---> JavaC --> Byte code .class ---> JVM --> Binary --> OS
- Multithreaded: running multiple blocks of code at the same time.
- high in performance : Multithreading, JIT[Just in Time Compiler]
- Robust : Best in class exception, error handling, memory handling.
- Dynamic : applications will be able to adapt
- Object oriented : In java, everything is represented with help of class and object
- portable

# JDK, JRE, JVM
Java Development Kit :
- it is a software. [oracle.com]
-it contains java compiler, profiler, debugger,
- some libraries
- Java Runtime Environment/Engine
    - JRE contains Java Virtual Machine
- we can use JDK for writing, compiling, debugging, executing the java applications
- JDK will be used by developers.
- We need JRE for execution which will be used end customer.

# Steps to write to first java program
Assumptions:
    - we have machine with operating system.

Step 1: Download and install JDK.[oracle.com]
Step 2: Set path.
        - it is optional if we are using IDE as IDE will itself set the temporary path
        - Command prompt/ powershell/ terminal :
            - These are the software present in the  OS which will help to interact with the OS.
            - These are command based software to interact with OS
          - If we want to give command[ compile java program with the help java compiler]
            to the OS with the help of command prompt/terminal

        To let Operating system know where is the java compiler, debugger, executor, we set the path
        - Path setting is nothing but, location of the java binaries given to OS.

Step 3: Write java code in a notepad and save the file with .java extension
step 4: compile the java file with the help of java compiler
        javac JavaFileName.java

step 5: execute the java app
        java ClassName


------------------------------------------------------------------

# How java works?
App.java --> javac App.java --> generates the .class containing byte code--> java App


- Variable : It is name given to a memory location address.
- Uses of variable: It is used to store data inside the memory or access the existing data

# Data type :
- It specifies three things
    - type of data that variable will hold
    - size of the memory location. memory requirement
    - It specifies range of allowed values that can be stored inside the variable
* Types of data types available in java:
1. byte - size: 1 byte, range: -128 to 127
2. short - size: 2 bytes, range: -32768 to 32767
3. int - size 4 bytes
4. long  - size 8 bytes
5. float - 4 bytes
6. double - 8 bytes
7. char - 2 bytes
8. boolean - 1 byte

How to create a variable?
- dataType variableName = value;
 e.g. int age = 50; // age is a variable, int is a data type, 50 is the value

# Type casting for primitives:
Type casting can be done for primitive as well as non-primitives.

converting one data type value into another data type value.
* Explicit typecasting - When we try to assign a bigger data type value to a smaller data type value then we have to perform explicit type casting
    int intValue = 100;
    byte byteValue = intValue;// we get compile time error
    - We tell to the compiler we are fine with the data loss.

    byte byteValue = (byte) intValue; // explicit type casting
    - Developer is responsible for explicit type-casting

* Implicit Type-casting :
    - when we try to assign small data type value to bigger data type value
    - Java compiler is responsible to perform implicit typecasting
    - There won't be any data loss in case of implicit type-casting.
          short shortValue = 100;
          int a = shortValue; // implicit type casting is done by the java compiler


explicit type casting --> upcasting, narrowing
implicit type casting -->  downcasting, widing

Autoboxing : converting primitive value into non-primitive
Unboxing : converting non-primitive value into primitive

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Operators
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Arithmetic operators : +, -, *, /, %
    - + operator will do mathematical addition when both the operands are of number type
2. String concatenation operator : +
    - it is the only operator which is overloaded in java.[does two jobs]
    - + will perform string concatenation when one of the operand is String type
    * expression evaluation will start from left to right


#input for arithmetic operator will be number type and output will also be of number type

--- Arithmetic operators are not applicable for boolean
byte, short, int , char (+,-,*, /, %) byte, short, int , char ---> int
byte, short, int , char, long (+,-,*, /, %) byte, short, int , char, long ---> long
byte, short, int , char, long, float (+,-,*, /, %) byte, short, int , char, long,float ---> float
byte, short, int , char, long, float,double (+,-,*, /, %) byte, short, int , char, long,float, double ---> double
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3. Comparison Operators : > ,< , >= , <=, ==, !=
 - These are applicable for number type.
 - for boolean only == and != is applicable

 output of Comparison operators : boolean

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Assignment operator : =
we use = operator, to assign the right hand side value to a variable to the left
left operand must be a variable type otherwise we get compile time error
right operand can be:
    1. direct value
    2. variable
    3. expression
    4. function call
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Logical operators:
Logical AND: &, &&
Logical OR: |, ||,
Logical XOR: ^
Logical NOT : !

- AND, OR, XOR, NOT these are not keywords available in java.

Pure logical operators : &&, ||

What is the difference between & and &&?
- & will solve all the conditions and at last will give the result.
- && will give the result immediatlly after the first false.
- && is called as short hand, short-circuit operator

! Not operators works on only boolean
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unary Operators : Operators which works on only operand
                   !
Binary Operators : Operators which works on two operands
                   - +, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, > ,< , >=, <=, &, &&, |, ||, ^
Ternary Operators : Operators which works on three operands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Increment / Decrement operators:
++, --
These are also called as unary operators
++ : increment the value by 1
-- : decrement the value by 1

Operand in the increment/decrement operation must be a variable otherwise we get CTE

Pre-increment :
    - When we use ++ operator before the operand, it is called as pre-increment.
    - e.g. int a = 1; ++a; SOP(a);//2
    - In this, we first increment the value by 1 ,and then we assign the value.
Post-increment :
    - When we use ++ operator after the operand, it is called as post-increment.
    - e.g. int a = 1; a++; SOP(a);//2
    - In this, we first assign the value and then increment the value by 1.

Pre-Decrement :
    - When we use -- operator before the operand, it is called as pre-decrement.
    - e.g. int a = 1; --a; SOP(a);//0
    - In this, we first decrement the value by 1 ,and then we assign the value.
Post-Decrement :
    - When we use -- operator after the operand, it is called as post-decrement.
    - e.g. int a = 1; a--; SOP(a);//0
    - In this, we first assign the value and then decrement the value by 1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bitwise operators:
& : AND
|: OR
^: XOR
~: Negation
<<: left shift
>> : right shift
>>>: unsigned right shift

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ternary operator: Which works on three operands

Conditional Operator:

operand1 ? operand2 : operand3

operand1 : condition
            1. direct value i.e. true or false
            2. variable of type boolean
            3. expression which results into boolean
            4. function call which returns boolean
Based on the condition, we get output.
        If the condition is true, code after ? gets executed
        If the condition is false, code after : gets executed

In conditional operator,
    input is a boolean value as operand1
    output will be either operand2 which is followed ? or operand3 which is followed :


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control statements : These are the statements which controls the flow of execution of the program
- If we do not want sequential execution, then we take help of control statements.

- control statements helps you
    - select specific code to execute
    - select specific code to skip the execution
    - select specific code to repeat the execution

1. Conditional Statements
    - it helps to select some part of the code to execute or skipping
    - if-else
    - switch

2. Looping / Repeat / Iterative statements
    -  It helps in executing the code repeatedly.
    - for
    - while
    - do-while
    - for each

3. Transfer statements
    - It helps in transferring the control from one location to another location
    - break
    - continue
    - return
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if: it is keyword
    if(condition){
        // statements
    }
    condition :
        1. it can be direct boolean value
        2. it can be expression whose result it boolean e..g (4 >3)
        3. it can be variable which is of type boolean
        4. it can be a function call which returns boolean type data.
        5. if write non-boolean value we get CTE.
    If the condition is true, the only code inside the {} will be executed
    If the condition is false, the  code inside the {} will not be executed

- we can write independent if.
 we use if-else and switch to select some code to either execute or skip it for execution based some value.

 if(true){ execute this}
 if(flalse){ do not execute this code}

 switch(value){
    case :
 }
  In switch, we compare single value across multiple cases.
  - doing equality operation

We go with the switch when number of equality operations are more than 3.

value :
    - allowed values for switch value place : byte, short, int char, Byte, Short, Integer, Character, String, enum
    - not allowed values : long, float, double, boolean, [Long, Float, Double, Boolean]

switch case lables and value provided in the switch must be of same data type otherwise we get CTE
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
Instance : It is an allocated memory space at runtime in the program.

Class :
- class is a keyword to create Class[classification]
- Class is a classification , categorization, grouping
- it is a plan, structure, template, blueprint, set of guidelines, set of rules to create objects
- we need class first inorder to create objects.
- we can create any number of objects with given class.
- so class will occupy less memory as compared to objects.

why do we need a class?
- we need class to create objects

How do we create a class?
e.g. class ClassName {
    // plan to create objects.
    }

Object:
- it is an instance of a class
- it is a memory space allocated at runtime for class type data.
- when we say we are creating object, we are actually allocating the memory space at run time
- Object is also called as instance
- But every instance need not be an object.
- Object is nothing but memory allocation.

Why do we need object?
- we need objects to store or represent real life physical or logical entities in the program at runtime

Every object has
    - state | variables | columns | attributes | data | properties |
    - behaviour | method | functions | procedure | routine | task | implementation

How do we create an object ?
e.g. class Student {
        int rollNumber;
        String studentName;
    }

    Student student = new Student();

    // Student : it is a derived data type
    // student : it is a reference variable which stores address or reference of an object
    // new : is a keyword to create object
    // Student(): it is a constructor. It is used to construct  or create object.

    new Student(): It is an object

# As part of the class, we can write different components
    - variables
        - local variable
        - instance variables
        - static variables
    - methods
        - instance method
        - static method
    - constructors
        - default constructors
        - zero parameterized constructor
        - parameterized constructor
    - blocks
        - instance block
        - static block
    - nested classes
        - inner class i.e. non-static nested class
        - static nested class
        - local inner class
        - anonymous class


1. we write java program in file with .java extension
2. we compile that .java file with java compiler
3. once .java file is compiled there will a .class file will be generated.
    - javac App.java
4. we run the .class file. we specify the class name which has main method
    - java App

JDK : Java Development Kit
- JDK helps in writing , compiling and executing the java applications.
- Developer needs to use JDK

JDK consists of compiler, libraries, JRE.
JRE consists of JVM

- We use java compiler  for compiling the java files
- we use JRE in turn JVM for java program execution.

What is the job of JVM?
- To convert the byte code into machine understandable code.

To execute the app : java ClassName

What is JVM ?
- Java virtual Machine
- JVM is abstract machine
- It is a software which is developed by Java people.


when we run the java app,
- JVM instance will be created, JVM will be started.

Once JVM is started,
    - ClassLoader: Loads the class into the memory.
    - Byte Code Verifier : It verifies the byte code from the .class
    - program is loaded into the different memory compartments.
        - Memory compartments
            - HEAP:
                - It is used to store the java objects
            - Stack
                - It is used to store local variables.
                - it is used the store method execution stack
            - Class or Method Area
                - It is used to store static variables
                - it is used to store class or method structures.
            - Native method Area
                - It is used to store the data related to non-java method such C, C++
            - Native Method Stack Area
                - It is used to store the data and method execution stack for non-java methods
            - PC Registers
                - It is used to store the next execution instruction

        * native method interface:
            - it is a framework or program to get the methods from native library and load into native method area
        * native methods : these are non-java code
        * native library : it is place where non-java code is present.
        * Java Execution Engine : Converts the code into machine understandable code.

    Java Compilers:
        - it compiles java source conde into byte code.
    JIT(Just in time Compilers):
        - They compile the byte code into the machine understandable code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class Components:

1. Local variable:
- it is used store the data which used to store temporary calculations in the program such
- it is stored in stack memory area.
- we create local variables inside the method, constructor, blocks
- Local variables can't be accessed outside where they have defined.
- Local variables will get the memory inside the stack memory area.
- Local variables will get the memory whenever method, constructor or block is called
- If we don't call the method, local variable will not be created.
- at the method execution end, all the variables which are local to this method will be deleted.

2. Instance variables:
What? - variables which are created outside of method, constructor,block at class level are called as instance variables
Why? - we use instance variables to store object specific information which is independent.
    e.g. Account details for each customer.
How? class Product{
            int productId;
            String productName;
        }
Where?- Instance variables will be stored as part an object inside the heap memory area
How many times IV gets the memory?
    - Every time we create object, instance variables will get the memory.
- Instance variables will be removed once the object is destroyed.

3. Static variables:
What - It is a variable which is created outside all methods, constructor, blocks at class level with static keyword
Why - We use static variables to store common data for all the objects
How many times they get the memory: Static variables will get the memory only once at time of class loading
when they will get the memory : at the time of class loading
where they are stored? static variables are stored inside the CLASS or METHOD memory area
How to access?
- we access static variables with the help classname


#To access instance variables we need object first
    Syntax: reference.InstanceVariableName

# To access static variables we don't need object. We need class to be loaded in the memory
    Syntax: ClassName.StaticvariableName

# Local variables are defined or created inside the method and accessed directly without any reference or classname
    syntax : variableName


_____________________________________________________
Every object has three things :
    1. identity
    2. state / variables / attributes / columns / data / information /
    3. behaviour / function / task / routine / procedure / implementation / method

What are methods ?
    - group of statements which are enclosed inside the curly braces which has a name
    - which returns some value [if no value then we write void]
    - might accept input[parameters]
        syntax:
           access_specifer return_type  methodName(input parameters){
            // group of statements
            //return statement optional
            }
Why do we need methods?
- we use methods for code reusability purpose



class components:
variables
    local variable : Tejal
    instance variable : Rohit sagare
    static variable : Akash Pawar
methods
    instance method : vaishnavi
    static method : mrugnayani
constructors
    default constructor: sandesh
    zero param constructors : mahesh
    parameterzed: Yash
    this keyword:  madhuri
blocks
    instance block : Nishant
    static block: Rohit
nested classes
    inner classes: Onkar
    static nested class : Anirudh
    local inner class : Saurabh
    anonymous class: Shivani

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What is instance block?
    - It is a block of code written inside the curly braces which does not have
        - name
        - parameters
        - access modifier
        - return type
    created at class level outside all other components

# Why we use instance block?
    - We use instance block for non-initialization activity such as logging, auditing
        - maintaining the object count.

# How to use instance block?
- Instance block will always be executed when we create an object
- We can create object with different constructor still instance block will be called irrespective of which constructor call

* we can write any number of instance blocks,
    but all the instance blocks will be combined and executed together for every object creation

# What is static block?
    - It is a block of code written inside the curly braces created with static which does not have
        - name
        - parameters
        - access modifier except static
        - return type
    created at class level outside all other components

# Why we use static block?
    - We use static block for performing one-time activity such as
        - connection to the database
        - connection to the file
        - connection to the server
        - loading a bigger file in the program

# How to use static block?
- we create the block as static {}
-  load the class in the memory

* we can write any number of static blocks,
    but all the static blocks will be combined and executed together for every object creation

Static block will be executed only once at the time of class loading

___________________________________________________________________________________________
Nested classes : A class defined inside another class
1. Non-static nested class or Inner class :
    - A class defined inside another class without static modifier
    - An inner class can't contain static members.

2. static nested class
    - A class defined inside another class with static modifier
    - It can contain both static and non-static members

3. Local Inner class
    - A class defined inside the method without any modifier
    - A Local Inner class can't contain static members.

4. Anonymous [abstraction]
___________________________________________________________________________________________

OOPS:
1. Encapsulation
- what it is ?
    - it is a process of binding data members and methods together
- why to use this?
    - to achieve data security
    - to get better control on the data
- how to achieve/ implement encapsulation in Java?
    - we make data members private so that it cannot be accessed outside the class directly

e.g. class Employee{
        private int employeeId;
        private String employeeName;

        //public getters and setters method

        public int getEmployeeId(){
            return this.employeeId;
        }

        public String getEmployeeName(){
            return this.employeeName;
        }

        public void setEmployeeId(int employeeId){
             this.employeeId = employeeId;
        }

        public void setEmployeeName(String employeeName){
             this.employeeName = employeeName;
        }

    }

#2. Inheritance
# What is it ?
- It is process of inheriting/acquiring the
    non-private, non-static & non-final members from one object into another object

* Super/ Parent/ Base class :
    - It is the class where we define the common methods and data.

* Child / Sub / Derived class
    - It is the class which inherits the Parent class


# Inheritance represents which type of relationship?
    - It represents IS-A type of relationship
    - we read Child IS-A of type Parent

# Why to use Inheritance?
    - to reuse the code
    - to avoid code duplication

# How to use or implement inheritance in Java?
    - we can use extends keyword to implement inheritance through classes
    - we define a class with common data and methods
    - we define another class which extends Parent class

e.g. class Loan {
        //common data
        //common methods
    }
    class PersonalLoan extends Loan {

    }

# what are the type of inheritance ?
1. Single Level inheritance
    - In this one class extends only one another clas
    - It is supported through classes
    - e.g. class A {}
        class B extends A {}


2. Multi-Level inheritance
     - In this one class extends only one another clas & that class extends another class & so on
     - It is supported through classes
      - e.g. class A {}
            class B extends A {}
            class C extends B {}
            class D extends C {}

3. Cyclic inheritance
    - When one class tries to extend itself
    - It is not support through classes
    - If we try to do it gives CTE
    e.g. class A extends A {}

4. Multiple inheritance
    - when one class extends more than one class then it is called as multiple inheritance.
    - It is not supported through classes
    - It is supported through interfaces
    - If we try to do it with classes it gives CTE
    - e.g.
            class A {}
            class B {}
            class C extends A, B {} //CTE
** What is diamond problem / ambiguity?
** Why multiple inheritance is not supported through classes?
    -- When one class tries to extend more than class,
        if both the parents have the same set of members
        then child class will get confuse which member to access
    - So to avoid this confusion, ambiguity, multiple inheritance is not supported through classes in java


5. Hybrid inheritance
    - when we combine multiple inheritance with any other type
    - it is not supported through classes.

6. Hierarchical inheritance
    -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Every constructor in java there is a first line in the constructor added implicitly
    that is call to the parent class constructor.
     --- super();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OOPS 3: Polymorphism:
Poly : many
morph : forms, methods, procedure, tasks, behaviour, function,

- What it is?
    - It is an ability of an object to change its behaviour either at compile time or runtime.

- what do you mean by behaviour change?
    -  object can change the behavior either at Compile time or run time.
    - it means having multiple methods with the same name but having with different implementation


* When object changes it behaviour at compile time, it is called as
    - compile time polymorphism
    - static binding
    - early binding
    *** call to the method is decided at compile time.

    Q. how to achieve compile time polymorphism?
    Ans. Method Overloading

* When object changes its behaviour at run time, it is called as
    - run time polymorphism
    - dynamic binding
    - late binding
    *** call to the method is decided at run time.

    Q. how to achieve run time polymorphism?
        Ans. Method Overriding

* What do you mean binding?
- Binding is nothing but deciding method call binding
- we decide which method will be called while executing the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is method overloading?
-- Defining multiple methods with the
    - same name
    - different signature
        - either different type of parameters
        - or different number of parameters.

    - either in the same class
    - or in the child class

- in method overloading, call to the method is decided at compile time.
- Method return type will not be considered in method overloading

* We can define the method in the parent class
    and same method in the child class with different signature
    it is called as method overloading

- Method overloading can happen in the same class as well as child class
- we can overload
    - private methods
    - static methods
    - final methods
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method overriding:
    - Defining a method in the child class with the
        - same name
        - same signature
        - same return type
        as of parent class method is called as method overriding

- Method return type will be considered in case of Method overriding.
- we cannot override
    - private methods
    - static methods
    - final methods

- For the access specifier we can do promotion not demotion
e.g. Parent class  --->    Child Class
    //default --->   //default, protected, public
    //protected ---> //protected, public
    //public ---->    //public

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OOPS:4 Abstraction

- It is  a process of hiding the implementation details and just exposing the functionality.
- abstract means INCOMPLETE
- final means COMPLETE
- we cannot use abstract and final together since they are opposite of each other.

# Concrete Method: A method which has implementation or curly brace
        e.g. class A {
                //concrete method
                void m1() {
                    //method body
                }
            }

# Concrete class: A class which can contain only concrete methods without any abstract modifier.

# Abstract method :
  - A method which is created without method body/curly braces with abstract keyword modifier
        e.g. abstract int add(int a, int b);
  - abstract methods cannot be defined inside the concrete class
  - we can define abstract methods inside the abstract class or interface.

# Abstract class :
   - A class which is created with abstract keyword modifier
   e.g.     abstract class ClassName {

            }
   - We can create empty abstract class.
   - It is not mandatory to write abstract methods inside the abstract class.
   - when one concrete class extends another abstract class,
       - then with the inheritance, child class gets the abstract methods.
       - we get compile time error. To resolve this error
        - either make the child class abstract
        - or override the abstract methods in the child class.

** Abstract class can contain
    - everything from concrete class
    - abstract methods

Q. can we create the object of an abstract class or interface?
Ans.- No. Since by declaring the class abstract, class becomes incomplete.
    - If we try to create object of an abstract class or an interface, we get
        compile time exception called as "InstantiationException"


Q. Can we write main method inside the abstract class and run it?
Ans. Yes. we can run it also.

Q. How can we call the constructor of an abstract class?
Ans. We create the child class object and from child class constructor,
    there will be call to the parent abstract class constructor


Q. can we overload and override the abstract methods?
Ans. we can overload as well as override the abstract methods.

Abstraction :
    - hiding of implementation details and exposing the functionality
    - to achieve abstraction we have abstract class and interface concept
    - with abstract class we cannot achieve 100% abstraction.
        - because in abstract class we can non-abstract method as well.
    - we cannot achieve multiple inheritance thorough abstract class.

interface :
- Uses of interface:
    - to achieve 100% abstraction
    - and support multiple inheritance we can use interface concept

- What is an interface?
    - it is a keyword using which we can create interface.
    - it is a fully unimplemented class.[ it is incomplete class]
    - Since it is incomplete,
        - we will have only abstract methods [till Java 7]
        - we cannot create the object of this.
        - After java 8, along with abstract methods,
            we can have default methods and static methods in the interface
    e.g.
        interface InterfaceName {

        }
        interface MessageService {

        }

Q. Does interface creates the .class file when compiled? Yes

Q. What all things we cannot write inside the interface in Java 8?
Ans. As part of an interface, we cannot write
    - instance variables
    - instance methods
    - instance block
    - Inner class
    - constructor
    - static block
    - Why we cannot have these components inside the interface?
        - To support multiple inheritance.


Q. What all things we can write inside the interface in Java?
Ans.
    - As part of Java 7 we can have
        - only abstract methods
        - variables of static final

    - As part of Java 8 we can have
        - abstract methods
        - variables of static final
        - default methods
        - static methods

# By default variables inside the interface are public static final
# By default methods inside the interface are public abstract
# By default nested classes inside the interface are public static


Valid scenarios:
1. One concrete/abstract class extends another concrete/abstract class
2. One concrete/abstract class implements another interface
3. one interface extends another interface

InValid scenarios:
1. one class extends interface
2. one interface extends another class
3. one interface implements another interface
4. one interface implements another class.

# when any concrete class implements an interface,
  - then it is compulsory for the child concrete class
    to override/implement the all abstract methods from interface

 # when any abstract class implements an interface,
  - then it is optional for the child concrete class
    to override/implement the all abstract methods from interface


# Marker interface:
    - It is an empty interface. No abstract methods
    - It can have default or static methods

# Functional Interface(SAM): Java 8 feature
    - A interface which contains Single Abstract method(SAM)
    - It can have any number default methods
    - It can have any number of static methods
    - we can use @FunctionalInterface annotation on the interface[optional]

Assignment: Find 20 predefined functional interface from Java 7 and Java 8
    1. Comparable
    2. Comparator

Q. can we  make abstract method  as private inside the interface? no
Q. can we  make abstract method  as static inside the interface? no
Q. can we  make abstract method  as final inside the interface? no

- What do you mean by implementing an interface or abstract class?
- We create concrete child class and override the abstract methods

# Anonymous class:
- It is a class which does not have a name.
- For anonymous class we define the class and create object of the class in the same line.
Q. Why to use Anonymous class?
Ans. We use anonymous class to give implementation for abstract class or interfaces.

Abstraction : hiding of implementation[method body] and exposing the functionality

How do we achieve the abstraction?
1. Abstract class
2. interface


- concrete method : method with body
						void m1(){
							SOP(“Hello”);
						}

- concrete class : a class which contains only concrete methods

- abstract method: method which is created without body and with abstract modifier

					abstract void m1();
	- we can’t write abstract methods inside the concrete class

# abstract class : class created with abstract modifier

					abstract class ClassName {

					}


- We can write the abstract methods either in the abstract class or interface.

-** abstract means INCOMPLETE

- We cannot create the object of an abstract class as well as interface.


- What all components we can write inside the abstract class?
	- We can write all the components from concrete class as well as abstract methods.


- is it compulsory to write abstract methods inside the abstract class or interface?
	- it is not compulsory. We can have empty class

Can we write main method inside the AC and run that? Yes.


- whenever a concrete class extends abstract class,
	then it is compulsory for child class to override
	all abstract methods from parent abstract class.



- whenever an abstract class extends another abstract class,
	then it is optional for child class to override
	all abstract methods from parent abstract class.




Can we create object of an abstract class? No.
Then how can we call constructor of an AC?
	- we create the child class object,
		then from child class constructor
	 there will be call to the Parent class constructor

With abstract class we can’t achieve
	1. 100% abstraction as we can have non-abstract methods in AC
	2. Multiple inheritance is not supported.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Anonymous class:
- it is a class without name.
- We use anonymous class for implementing abstract classes or interfaces.
- Since anonymous class don’t have name,
	we have combine the class definition and object creation
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

interface: fully unimplemented class i.e. INCOMPLETE class
	- it is a keyword using which we can create the interface
	- interface is a fully unimplemented class.
	- it will have only abstract methods till java 7
	- From Java 8, we can have
		- abstract methods
		- default methods
		- static methods

- Since it is incomplete, we can’t create the object of an interface.

- if we try to create object of an abstract class or interface
	 we get one compile time exception InstatiaionException

- why do we need interface?
	1. To support 100% abstraction
	2. To support Multiple inheritance.

* what is “implements” keyword?
- We use it to implement an interface.

What do mean by implementing an interface?
- We create a subclass with implements keyword and
	override the abstract methods

	class Child implements ParentInterface {
		// override abstract methods
	}

Valid cases:
1. One class extends another class
2. One class implements another interface
3. One interface extends another interface.

Invalid cases:
1. One class extends another interface
2. One interface extends another class
3. One interface implements another interface.


Q. How multiple inheritance is supported through interfaces?
A. One class can implement multiple interfaces
	e.g.
		interface I1 {}
		interface I2 {}
		class Child implements I1, I2{}
	- To support multiple inheritance, interface cannot contain
		- IV, IM, IB, SB, IC, Constructor


By default,
	variables are public static final
	methods are public abstract
	nested classes are public static


# When one concrete class implements an interface,
then it is mandatory for the child class to override all the abstract methods

# When one abstract class implements an interface,
then it is optional for the child class to override all the abstract methods
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#Functional Interface:
- it is a new feature of Java 8.
- An interface which contains Single Abstract Method(SAM)
	- any number of default methods
	- any number of static methods
- We can mark functional interface with @FunctionalInterface annotation
- If we write 	@FunctionalInterface over the functional interface,
	- if we introduce new abstract method inside the interface we get compile time error
	e.g.
		@FunctionalInterface
		interface I {
			void m1();
		}

Q. What are the different ways to implement a functional interface?
    1. Traditional way
        - create a separate subclass and override the method
        e.g.
        interface I{
            void m1();
        }

        class A implements I {
            void m1(){}
        }

        I i = new A();
        i.m1();

    2. Using Anonymous class
        interface I{
                    void m1();
                }

        I i  = new I() { void m1(){} };
        i.m1();
